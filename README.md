📊 Operational Deployments
QSR Compliance Transformation
Role: Operations Lead / Pilot Manager
Implementation: Deployed device-bound evidence logging (Bluetooth probes) across 60 locations.
Result: Reduced non-compliance incidents by 90% and eliminated audit failures over 18 months.
Throughput Optimization
Role: General Manager / Analyst
Implementation: Analyzed Kitchen Display System (KDS) timestamps to identify production bottlenecks; re-engineered batching logic.
Result: Reduced peak-hour wait times by 12%.
ESG Telemetry Pipeline
Role: Technical Product Owner
Implementation: Architected the carbon-ops ledger to track AI workload energy consumption via BigQuery.
Result: Identified $127k in annualized savings via cost/carbon correlation.
