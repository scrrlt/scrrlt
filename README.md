📊 Operational Deployments

QSR Compliance Transformation

Role: Operations Lead / Pilot Manager

Implementation: Deployed device-bound evidence logging (Bluetooth probes) across 60 locations.

Result: Reduced non-compliance incidents by 90% and eliminated audit failures over 18 months.

Throughput Optimization

Role: General Manager / Analyst

Implementation: Analyzed Kitchen Display System (KDS) timestamps to identify production bottlenecks; re-engineered batching logic.

Result: Reduced peak-hour wait times by 12%.

ESG Telemetry Pipeline

Role: Technical Product Owner

Implementation: Architected the carbon-ops ledger to track AI workload energy consumption via BigQuery.

Result: identified $127k in annualized savings via cost/carbon correlation.
